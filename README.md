# SP2019-SE3340.503-TeamProject-WeOverFlow--MindReaderGame
This is a small game that calculates a user's whole number less or equal to 63 throughout a series of questions. This game was developed on school term of spring of 2019, at UTD for SE3340.SEC503: Computer Architecture class.

To Run the game you need to have MARS; we use version 4.5. Make sure all the files posted here are in the same folder. Then, under MARS settings make sure that the following option is marked: "Assemble all files in directory", this will allow MARS to use the MACROS file and any other file that the program may include and need to be run.

Professor's instructions:

The topic for the team project this semester is the Mind Reader game. 

For a feel of the game visit

Minimum requirements for the program:
The game is for a human player and your program is the 'mind reader'. Your program must display the cards, get input from the player then correctly display the number that the player has in mind.
At the end of a game, the program will ask the player if he/she wants to play another game and then repeat or end the program. 
The 'cards' MUST be generated and displayed once at a time during a game, i.e. NOT pre-calculated and stored in memory. The order of displayed cards MUST be random. 
The player input (keystrokes) should be minimum
The ASCII based display is the minimum requirement. Creative ways to display the game (e.g. colors) will earn the team extra credits.
If the player gives an invalid input, an error message is displayed to explain why the input was not valid. 
Extra credits will be given for:

Graphic/color display
Extra features of the programs (e.g. background music, sounds or music to indicate invalid input, pleasant display etc...) implemented and documented.
Any other notable creativity that the team has shown.
You must document these extra credit features in your report and explain well to unlock these extra credits.

Submission Requirements:
At the end of the semester by the due date, EACH student must submit a ZIP file containing

1. A project report (in Word format) covering

   a) a description of the program,

   b) the challenges that you and your team had  and how did you or the team overcome them,

   c) what you have learned by doing the project,

   d) a discussion of algorithms and techniques used in the program, e.g. how to generate and display the cards? how does the program work?

   e) contributions of each team member (peer evaluation), 

   f) any suggestions you may have (optional).

2. A short video clip demonstrating the program in action. (If the video is too big you can post it on a website, e.g. youTube, and submit the link). The video should have audio narration explaining the behavior of your program.

3. All MIPS assembly language modules that are needed to run your program.

4. A user manual on how to run and how to use the program.

Obviously items 2. 3 and 4. are the same for all team members but item 1 must be prepared by each student individually (but some sections of the report, e.g. a) and d), can be shared).

Make sure you write what have you learned by doing this project and peer evaluation part individually.


How will points be given to team members?
First, the implementation and documentation of the program will be graded based on the requirements listed above.
Then the peer evaluation section of the project report (section e) will be taken into consideration when assigning points to each team member. If your peers report that you did not contribute to the team project you may get ZERO pts for this assignment 
Teams should get together as soon as possible to discuss the requirements and decide on how to break down the task to assign to each team member. Feel free to contact the TA/Grader or the instructor if more information is needed.

Happy coding!
